GAUSSIAN PROCESS CLUSTERING OF MULTIVARIATE TIME SERIES

  This software was written by

Nicholas A. Heard at
Department of Mathematics, Imperial College, London.

  for implementation of the methods described in the Imperial College
  technical report "A quantitative study of gene regulation involved
  in the immune response of Anopheline mosquitoes: An Application of
  Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering of Curves"(2003) by N A Heard, C C
  Holmes and D A Stephens.

INSTRUCTIONS

Assuming that the programs have already been unpacked.

1. Change the definition of "CXX" in Makefile to use your local ANSI C
   compiler

2. Type "make all" to form the executable programs


*********************************************************************

RUNNING THE PROGRAMS

The makefile creates 3 programs:
i. mvn_spline_fitting
ii. mvn_spline_clustering
iii. mvn_spline_mcmc_clustering

The first fits a Gaussian process to the data and writes the mean
level function to a file specified by the option predfile=.

The programs all expect two input files to be given at the command line,
one containing the time points of the observations and the other the
observed responses.  A range of extra optional parameters/file paths
are also available.

To see a list of all the optional parameters, run the program with the argument 'help', e.g.

./mvn_spline_clustering help
